# Socio-Hydrologic Model - FEMA NFIP / Census Data 
This repository contains the following: 
* SocHydModel.R: socio-hydrological model of Barendrecht et al. (2019)
* PreProcess_ClaimsPolicies.R: pre-processing functions to aggregate NFIP claims and policy records by US metropolitan area and year
* PreProcess_CensusPop.R: pre-processing function to aggregate census population totals by US metropolitan area and year 
* PreProcess_SocHyd_TS.R: merges separate policy, claims, and census data into an annual time series
* DDS_Wrapper.R: integrates Socio-hydrological model into the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) algorithm of Tolson & Shoemaker (2007). 
* NSE.R: computes Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency 
* RMSE.R: computes Root Mean Square Error
* SocioHydroModel_Housing_ITS.R : socio-hydrological model of Poudel et al. (2023) that assumes Interrupted Time Series (ITS) recovery of housing values post-flood
* SocioHydroModel_Housing_Krecovery.R : socio-hydrological model of Poudel et al. (2023) that assumes K shaped recovery of housing values post-flood
* SocioHydroModel_Housing_Sigmoid.R : socio-hydrological model of Poudel et al. (2023) that assumes Sigmoidal recovery of housing values post-flood
